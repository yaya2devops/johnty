Yahya (Arabic: يحيى, romanized: Yaḥyā), also spelled Yehya, is an Arabic male given name. It is an[a] Arabic form of the given name {John}, originally Aramaic Yohanan (Yəhôḥānān יְהוֹחָנָן‎ "YHWH is gracious"), i.e. primarily John the Baptist, who is known as Yahya ibn Zakariyya in Islam, and is considered a prophet in Islam. For this reason, Yahya is a comparatively common name in the Muslim world. The related Biblical name of Jehiah (Yᵊḥîyâ יְחִיָּה "YHWH lives") has the Arabic form Yaḥiyyā يَحِيَّى.[1], having the same Arabic consonantal text as the name Yahya does. —From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

John had a significant impact on my career and who I am today. 

He was one of the reasons I never missed a workout. Mostly.

He was the reason I had faith in the portal.

He was also a great source of my discipline and desire to make my life better in the long run.

Obviously, I can't thank him enough, but I can be of a help for someone getting to know him. 

So here's a collection of some of his favorite things of all time (Technical and non-technical).
