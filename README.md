John had a significant impact on my career and who I am today. 

He was one of the reasons I never missed a workout. 

He was the reason I had faith in the portal.

He is also the source of my discipline and desire to make my life better in the long run.

Obviously, I can't thank him enough, but I can be of a help for someone getting to know him. 

So here's a collection of some of his favorite things of all time (Technical and non-technical).
